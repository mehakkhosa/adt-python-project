# Abstract Data Types (ADTs) in Python

This project implements various Abstract Data Types (ADTs) in Python, focusing on concepts like constructors, selectors, modifiers, and recognizers. It includes examples of:
- **Random Number Generators**: Implements a generator using XORShift for 32-bit and 64-bit states.
- **Coordinates**: Provides functions for creating and manipulating 2D coordinates.
- **Parcel**: Implements a Minesweeper-like tile system with multiple states (covered, marked, mined, etc.).

## Features
- **Random Number Generator (TAD gerador)**:
  - Generates random numbers and characters based on XORShift.
  - Supports 32-bit and 64-bit states.
- **2D Coordinate Handling (TAD coordenada)**:
  - Creates and manipulates 2D coordinates with constraints.
  - Provides neighbor detection and string conversion.
- **Parcel Handling (TAD parcela)**:
  - Models Minesweeper-like tiles with various states.
  - Provides utility functions for marking, cleaning, and hiding mines.

## Example Usage
## How It Works
Each Abstract Data Type is implemented with:

Constructors: For creating instances.
Selectors: For accessing properties.
Modifiers: For changing states.
Recognizers and Comparators: To validate and compare instances.
High-Level Functions: To perform specific tasks like generating random values or finding neighbors.

## Running the Code
To execute the code:
´´´bash
python adt_implementation.py

## Technologies Used
